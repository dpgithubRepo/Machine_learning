    "# When Traditional Programming Fails\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a basic example of classifying ham and spam emails. If this has to be done in a traditional programming way, we need to write a rule-based engine for classification. For example, the Programmer will have to write a code to check if there is a particular string in the mail content and also keep a count of it and if that particular text/string count crosses a certain number in the mail then the rule classifies the mail as spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the text which is written in the rule is 'Amazing offer' and the rule works well and classifies the mail as spam if the text appears in the mail for a certain number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a later point, the spammer may change the text 'Amazing offer' to 'Amazing off3r' then the rules engine will fail to classify such mails as spam. For the programmer to handle this kind of issues he has to maintain a huge list of texts which fall under spam....\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very basic example discussed to understand the issue with Traditional programming for such tasks, but this complexity is simple as shown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example of speech recognition, with the traditional programming techniques if you want to identify a speech recognition of words 'one','two' then we can have a simple rule mapping the speech to a number. But if you need to map a hundred words and identify then the rules become big and if there is a need to map thousands of words to numbers then it is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if it comes to image and video processing then the traditional programming falls flat. Having said that Traditional programming has its own importance and can never be underlooked or neglected"
